                <h1>Project Riley</h1>
                <h3>Client: Curious Technologies</h3>
                <h3>Role: UX</h3>
                <p>
                    I worked on a team of three UX designers to create a mobile app that visualizes data from a remote sensor chip. The client, Curious Technologies, was interested in leveraging this technology for a physics teaching application. Our task was to research the problems that physics teachers and students currently face, develop wireframes, and test a prototype within a three week timeframe. Due to an NDA, the names of the sensor chip and application will not be divulged in this case study. 
                </p>
                <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    We started researching by looking at the competitive landscape for sensor technology. This included inertial measurement units made by manufacturers like Bosch and Sparkfun, scientific probes from Vernier and Pasco, and also mobile applications like Physics Toolbox that use the sensors built into smartphones. I then created a competitor matrix to look for potential market opportunities. There is an obvious space open for a product that utilizes a mobile sensor and is easy enough for the average high schooler to use.
                </p>
                <div id="rileyMatrix">
                    <a href="images/riley_matrix.png">
                        <img src="images/riley_matrix.png" alt="">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <h2>Domain Research, Interviews, and Contextual Inquiry</h2>
                <p>
                    To learn more about the issues faced by physics teachers and students, we looked at existing qualitative data and talked to subject matter experts. The SMEs included an award winning physics teacher and co-creator of Physics Toolbox, and a former physics teacher who is now the tech administrator for two high schools. We learned some interesting facts by doing so:
                </p>
                <ul class="rileyList">
                    <li><span>34%</span> of high school physics teachers have a degree in physics</li>
                    <li><span>30%</span> of key, new concepts are retained by students in a traditional lecture format</li>
                    <li><span>50%</span> of physics teachers believe old equipment is a problem</li>
                    <li>For a school to spend money on <span>new equipment</span>, it <span>must be used repeatedly</span> for many years</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We then recruited and interviewed fifteen subjects including students, physics teachers, physicists, and physics enthusiasts. On top of that, we were invited to visit a nearby high school physics class to sit in on a lecture and talk with the students. 
                </p>
                <div id="rileyInquiry">
                    <img src="images/riley_inquiry.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h2>Research Synthesis</h2>
                <div id="rileyAffinity">
                    <img src="images/riley_affinity.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Using all of the information from our research, we set out making an affinity diagram to help organize our thoughts. We had several key insights afterwards:
                </p>
                <ul class="rileyList">
                    <li>Students struggle with fundamental physics concepts due to <span>lack of context</span></li>
                    <li>These fundamentals boil down to <span>altitude, velocity, acceleration, and force</span></li>
                    <li><span>Understanding graphs</span> is difficult for students, but is important for them to be able to do</li>
                    <li><span>Hands-on activities</span> solidify understanding of abstract concepts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To help inform our designs going forward, we created personas that best represent the people we interviewed. They included a motivated student who struggles with physics, a veteran teacher who wants his students to truly understand physics, and a newer teacher who wants to engage her students and inspire a love for learning.
                </p>

                  <li><img src="images/riley_maddie.png" /></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Ideation & Iteration</h2>
                <p>
                    After synthesis, it was time for us to put pen to paper and begin ideating possible applications. First and foremost, we designed with our primary personas in mind, but we also created design principles based on our research findings: 
                </p>
                <ul class="rileyList">
                    <li><span>Versatile</span> - Using the application will help students learn multiple physics concepts</li>
                    <li><span>Simple</span> - Data should be easy to digest</li>
                    <li><span>Accessible</span> - Beneficial to students and enthusiasts alike</li>
                    <li><span>Visual</span> - Help users relate graphs with actual events</li>
                    <li><span>Relevant</span> - Focus on the real world rather than abstractions</li>
                </ul>
                <div id="rileySketches">
                    <a href="images/riley_sketches.jpg">
                        <img src="images/riley_sketches.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Our group ideated by sketching out ideas and screens individually and then came back together for critiques. After doing this for several rounds, we each created paper prototypes to test on users. After receiving positive feedback on certain elements of our prototypes, we decided on certain key functionalities for the final wireframes: 
                </p>
                <ul class="rileyList">
                    <li>Data should be captured and displayed in <span>real-time</span></li>
                    <li>Provide the ability to <span>compare graphs with recorded videos</span></li>
                    <li>Use captured data for <span>gamification</span></li>
                    <li>Allow users to <span>manipulate data</span></li>
                </ul>
                <div id="rileyBoard">
                    <a href="images/riley_board.jpg">
                        <img src="images/riley_board.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <h2>Application Map</h2>
                <p>
                    To help organize and relate the different screens with each other, I created this application map to help guide navigation and flow.
                </p>
                <div id="rileyMap">
                    <a href="images/riley_appmap.png">
                        <img src="images/riley_appmap.png" alt="">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <h2>Wireframes: Key Screens</h2>
                <p>
                    Here are the final wireframes for key screens of the application. The app shows versatility because it can be used just as a recording tool or for a class activity. Veteran teachers have the ability to think up their own activities or newer teachers can choose from pre-packaged ones. It is accessible by not having logins so teachers and students can pick it up and start using it immediately. The graphs are easy to understand because you can compare them right next to recorded video. Finally, activities are gamified using a leaderboard, which research proved increases student engagement.
                </p>

                </ul>
                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <p>
                    Here is the prototype the team presented to Curious Technologies at the end of three weeks. They were very pleased with the designs and could not believe the amount of work we were able to complete in a short amount of time.

                <h2>Going forward</h2>
                <p>
                    We noted to the client that we have some recommendations for the application for production and future versions:
                </p>
                <ul class="rileyList">
                    <li>Some functionality depends on Internet connection, so connecting students in an activity via Bluetooth would be optimal</li>
                    <li>Giving students the ability to create hypotheses and test them would be great, but we did not have time to implement such features in the short time frame</li>
                    <li>Create an online forum for teachers to share activity ideas</li>
                    <li>Add advanced features like plotting regressions and displaying slopes and areas</li>
                </ul>
