    			<h1>Flint</h1>
    			<h3>Client: DESIGNATION</h3>
    			<h3>Role: UX, UI, Branding</h3>
                <p>
                    In response to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's efforts to improve college readiness for US students, I worked in a small group at DESIGNATION to find a way to improve education through innovation. Our challenege was to design an online platiform for high school students to discover interests, prepare for college, and create a joy of learning. We had two team members focus on UX while another member and I focused on UI, but I assisted in a few areas of the research and synthesis process.
                </p>
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    We conducted interviews with seventeen students, three teachers, and five subject matter experts. In addition, the UX members collected survey data and did a domain analysis to better understand the current education landscape. As a team, we synthesized the findings in an affinity diagram.

                    <img src="images/flint_diagram.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>We came out of the research phase with a few key takeaways:</p>
                <ul id="flintTakeaways">
                    <li>
                        Students understand the importance of college and stress out trying to find the right one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        High school students associate college major with their future career and feel unprepared for college if they haven't decided on a career path.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        High school students need an easy-to-use platform to access career information and real-world advice that helps them translate interests into a career.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Wireframes and prototype</h2>
                <p>
                    After synthesizing our research, the UX members started creating wireframes. They ended up with a website called Flint that allows students to explore careers based on their interests and also connect with real world professionals through webinars to find out what it's really like doing a certain job.
                </p>
                <div id="flintWireframes">
                    <img src="images/flint_wireframes.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Using these wireframes, a prototype was put together for user testing. We were able to remotely test the prototype with three high school students for feedback, which was almost unanimously positive. The biggest thing the students felt missing was more information on colleges. They said college is almost all they think about at a certain point in high school so this website needs to help them make that big decision.

                    <img src="images/flint_testing.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h2>Style exploration</h2>
                <p>
                    I thought of a bunch of possible directions to take the aesthetic, two of which are shown below. I ended up going with the second one because it felt more youthful and relatable.
                </p>
                <div id="flintTiles">
                    <img src="images/flint_tile1.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/flint_tile2.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <h2>Final logo</h2>
                <figcaption>
                    The logo I created for Flint centers around the idea of a spark. I played around with using a flame in the logo, but felt the spark represented the heart of Flint; helping to start the fire, not the fire itself.
                </figcaption>
                <figure id="flintLogo">
                    <img src="images/flint_logo.gif" alt="">
                </figure>
                <h2>Final screens</h2>
                <p>
                    The final screens use shades of red to signify passion. The idea behind this was I wanted students using the website to feel excited about finding their passion, functioning almost like a matchmaking service. Something we found in the research phase was that students are increasingly using phones more than desktops to surf the internet so I made the website responsive for mobile.
