    			<h3>Client: DESIGNATION</h3>
    			<h3>Role: UX, UI, Branding</h3>
                <p>
                    This mock project had us creating an application for disprupting the fast-growing organic food industry. While year-to-year industry growth of about 20% is impressive, venture capitalists are worried the high price of organic foods is limiting its profit potential. Working in groups for UX research and individually for the UI and branding, we were tasked with designing a disruptive technology to overcome the price hurdle the organic industry is now facing.
                </p>
                <h2>Research and synthesis</h2>
                <p>
                    Between the members of our group, we were able to conduct seventeen user interviews to better understand people's grocery shopping habits and opinion on organic foods. One thing we noticed was that while consumers prefer healthy options, convenience is a much larger factor when buying food. However, the biggest discovery we made was that it's not the high price of organic foods keeping many people from buying them, it's actually the lack of information about the products which would justify the higher price. We found that people have a general idea of what the term "organic" means, but know very little about the environmental and ethical benefits involved. With this and other findings, we created a persona to base our designs on:

                <div id="marci">
                    <img src="images/sprightly_persona.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <figcaption>
                    After affinity diagramming, we were able to create a detailed journey map of Marci's grocery shopping experience. This would show opportunities for addressing pain points and inform our interaction design in the wireframes.

                </figure>
                <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <p>
                    From here, group work ended and we individually created wireframes for an organic food app. I made an app called Sprightly that has three main functions:
                </p>
                <ul id="sprightlyFunctions">
                    <li>
                        Generate interest and frequent usage by showcasing recipes with organic ingredients.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide utility by showing detailed product information and making ingredients easily transferable to a shopping list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making it convenient to purchase organics by showing users organic alternatives to their shopping list items and allowing them to reserve these items at their local store.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div id="sprightlyWireframes">
                    <img src="images/sprightly_wireframes.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <h2>Style exploration</h2>
                <p>
                    After heuristic evaluations and minor changes to the interaction design, I began exploring possible directions for the visual design. One style I created was very relatable, using a hand-written font and earthy colors which makes the organic foods feel local and personal. The other style, which I ended up using for my final design, is very clean and stylish. This gives the products a sense of quality that justifies the higher price tag and also allows the high resolution photos throughout the app to be the main focus.
                </p>
                <div id="sprightlyTiles">
                    <img src="images/sprightly_tile2.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="images/sprightly_tile1.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h2>Final screens</h2>
                <figcaption>
                    The final mockups reflect the combination of my user research and style exploration. The Sprightly logo is subtly used to inform the user of organic options for their list items. I also made a screen showing how 3D touch for the iPhone 6S is utilized in the organic options screen.
