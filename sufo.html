    			<h1>SuFo</h1>
    			<h3>Client: SugarSnap</h3>
    			<h3>Role: UI</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.sugarsnap.com/" target="_blank">SugarSnap</a> is a Chicago-based startup that creates web-based tools and apps for improving the healthcare system. They are in the process of building a web application called SuFo (short for Surgeon's Forum) that will make it cheap and easy for physicians to watch video content and receive Continuing Medical Education (CME) credit. Most American states and Canadian provinces require doctors to earn these credits to keep their licenses, so this service will be in high demand once launched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Already having detailed wireframes, the client gave me three weeks to complete the user interface for SuFo. In this timeframe, I did not need to worry about branding or logo, I just had to focus on fleshing out the wireframes with a visual direction.
                </p>
                <h2>Style exploration</h2>
                <p>
                    After researching the aesthetics of competitors and other applications that the client wanted to visually emulate, I created three style tiles for SugarSnap to see. 
                </p>
                <div id="sufoTiles">
                    <a href="images/sufo_tiles.png">
                        <img src="images/sufo_tiles.png" alt="">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The client said they favored the third tile for its color palette and UI elements, but said they also like the "clean with pop" of the first tile and the playful elements of the second. With this feedback, I started thinking about the overall direction I wanted to take for the high fidelity mockups. 
                </p>
                <div id="sufoInspiration">
                    <a href="images/sufo_inspiration.png">
                        <img src="images/sufo_inspiration.png" alt="">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The main takeaway I got from the client feedback was that they weren't looking to mimic the professional, sterile look of many other medical websites. They specifically mentioned liking the playful feel of one of my tiles so I decided to run with that idea. I drew inspiration from three popular applications that do a great job of keeping things lighthearted, but are still highly functional tools that look appropriate in work environments.
                </p>
                <h2>Final screens - Desktop</h2>
                <p>
                    I kept mostly the same color palette that the client liked from one of my tiles, but lightened it a bit by using a purple instead of slate. I also made the screens more fun and playful by rounding all corners on UI elements. I incorporated a cloud motif to play with the idea that doctors are uploading video content into a larger community.

                </div>
                <p>
                    The client mentioned that many doctor's will not only want these video's to attain CME credits, but also to prep for upcoming surgeries. Often times, this is done on the go, walking around the hospital. For that reason, I made screens responsive with breakpoints for tablets and phones.
                </p>
                <h2>Phone</h2>
                <div id="sufoPhones">
                    <a href="images/sufo_phones.png">

                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    When the screens were presented to the client at the end of the three weeks, they were very happy with how it turned out. They felt I made the correct adjustments based on their feedback and are excited to use the designs when they launch SuFo.
